# GRAIN üåæ

## Go Relay Archetecture for Implementing Nostr

GRAIN is an open-source Nostr relay implementation written in Go. This project aims to provide a robust and efficient Nostr relay that currently supports the NIP-01 of the nostr protocol.

## Features

- **NIP-01 Protocol Support**: GRAIN (nearly)fully supports NIP-01 for WebSocket communication.
- **Event Processing**: Handles all events by category and kind.
- **MongoDB üçÉ**: Utilizes MongoDB to store and manage events efficiently.
- **Scalability**: Built with Go, ensuring high performance and scalability.
- **Open Source**: Licensed under the MIT License, making it free to use and modify.

## Configuration

Grain will automatically create the configurations and relay metadata files necessary if they do not already exist when you first run the program.

They are created in the root directory of Grain. Feel free to change any coinfigurations you want in these files.

### TODO

- configurable event purging
  - by category
  - by kind
  - by time since latest
- create whitelist/blacklist functionality
  for:
  - valid nip05 domain
  - pubkey
  - npub
  - kind int
  - kind 1 wordlist
