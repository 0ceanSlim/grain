## Go Relay Archetecture for Implementing Nostr

GRAIN is an open-source Nostr relay implementation written in Go. This project aims to provide a robust and efficient Nostr relay that currently supports the NIP-01 of the nostr protocol.

## Features

- **NIP-01 Protocol Support**: GRAIN (nearly)fully supports NIP-01 for WebSocket communication.
- **Event Processing**: Handles all events by category and kind.
- **MongoDB üçÉ**: Utilizes MongoDB to store and manage events efficiently.
- **Scalability**: Built with Go, ensuring high performance and scalability.
- **Open Source**: Licensed under the MIT License, making it free to use and modify.

## Configuration

Configuration options can be set through a configuration file.

There is an example config in this repo. Copy the example config to config.yml to get started

```bash
cp config.example.yml config.yml
```

### TODO

- Handle Kind 5 explicitely to delete Events from the Database
- Handle Ephemeral event
  - configurable amount of time to keep ephemeral notes
- configurable event purging
  - by category
  - by kind
  - by time since latest
- create whitelist/blacklist functionality
  for:
